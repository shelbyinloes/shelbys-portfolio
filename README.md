###Description: 
    This is a React app to tell you a litte bit more about me, my job history, projects, and how to contact me! 

###Why: 
    I wanted a place where I can showcase my work for friends, family, professional network, and potential employers. Having a portfolio site was important because it gets to show more of my personality compared to a resume or my LinkedIn page. 

###Goals: 
    I would like to make this even more visually exciting as well as increase the quality content. The more I continue to build, the better the portfolio will get! 

###Deployment: 
    Site is deployed using Netlify: (https://shelbyportfolio.netlify.com/)

###Issues/Bugs:
    Although I have some media-queries already in here, it does need some touch up on several of the components to make it more mobile friendly.
